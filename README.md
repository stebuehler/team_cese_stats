# team_cese_stats
## To Do
* Bugfix: Ranking when no set and point data is available
* Change total bar chart to sets
* Graph below Team stats: Matchup matrix with colouring
* Bar chart below total stats: Change group by to Session if just one year.
* Spieler and Team Steckbriefe
* Scatter chart (punkte plus minus, color = sieg oder niederlage)
* Additional filters for weekday and morning / afternoon
* Refactoring of code - each chart with its file?
* Refactoring of df prep with dplyr
